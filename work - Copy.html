With all the intricate services and benefits, along with all the clich√© stereotypes people tend to think of in this field of work.

While the dev team's responsibilities included the creation of these applications, ours was to market them and their products, as individual entities. This website is minimalistic, yet it provides the message we intended for it. This website was one of the many that allowed me to strengthen my knowledge with video content on webpages across multiple devices and sizes. Safari browsers had a unique setting that blocks video content on websites, and that also gave me the opportunity to learn more about safari browser settings and functionality.

            Astralfoods was one of most important clients and the relationship with them has always been very strong. Their website was redesigned on 2020 and they are still requesting regular updates and documents to be uploaded whenever they release new information on the JSE. I would ocasionally upload new things every month, and when financial year end has passed, I was tasked to upload all of their updates relating this as well. I would personally remain in contact with them when updates were needed, and I was tasked with the responsibility of making these updates and keeping our clients happy. Major updates would occur yearly, and mothly updates included 
    SENS and general meeting.
